    "\n",
    "We are going to investigate flight datasets in order to gain insights on airline on-time performance from 2005 to 2008. The goal is to understand reasons that tend to make a flight delayed or cancelled. In particular, we will be intersted in the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there certain destination or arrival cities that are home to more delays or cancellations?\n",
    "* What are the preferred times for flights to occur? \n",
    "* Are there any changes over multiple years?\n",
    "\n",
    "* When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?\n",
    "* Do older planes suffer more delays?\n",
    "* How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?\n",
    "* How well does weather predict plane delays?\n",
    "* Can we detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?\n",
    "* What are the flight patterns \n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "hich factors are most likely to be the root of a delays ? (computing the total delays per factor)\n",
    "Is there a relationship between delay and : company ? plane ? city ? continent ?\n",
    "Which factors are most likely to be the root of a delays for a given company ? for a given plane ? (computing the total delays per factor)\n",
    "How does the number of passengers/seats on a flight may impact its delay ?\n",
    "How does the weather report impact flights delay ? (globally ? per company ?)\n",
    "Which are the company that encounter more delay ?\n",
    "Which are the departure that encounter more delay ?\n",
    "Does the age of the planes impact its delay ?\n",
    "Which days of the week  encounter more delay ? (to be answered by origin and by destination) ; do the same thing for the months of the year\n",
    "Compare the companies on-time performance over the years\n",
    "Which companies computed the most CarrierDelay ?\n",
    "Which cities computed the most WeatherDelay ? (globally ? per company ?)\n",
    "Which companies computed the most delay ? (sum up all delays for each observation)\n",
    "Explore the departure delays. (per company; per plane; per plane model; per plane age; per plane manufacturer; per city; per weither )\n",
    "Is the flight distance somehow correlated to the delay ? (the longer the distance, the longer the delay ?)\n",
    "How does the flights cancellation are distributed ? (over the months ? over the companies ? over the reasons ?)\n",
    "How does the flights cancellation evolved ? (generally ? per company ?)\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------------------------\n",
    "We will explore the data while having three identities in mind:\n",
    "* a passenger, who want to know before hand if he may be stuck in an airport waiting for his flight, and plan accordingly.\n",
    "* an airport administrative, who want to understand issues causing delay, in order to know what he can work on so that he improve the aiport performance.\n",
    "* a freight company administrative, who also want to understand issues causing delay, in order to know which aspect of his planes he should take note of so that he improve his planes performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have 29 features, whose signification we obtained through a search over [the net](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?QO_VQ=EFD&Yv0x=D) :\n",
    "* **Year**: year (e.g. 2008)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Month**: 1-12 \n",
    "\n",
    "* **DayofMonth**: 1-31\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DayOfWeek**: 1 (Monday) - 7 (Sunday)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DepTime**: Actual departure time (local, hhmm).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CRSDepTime**: Scheduled departure time (local, hhmm).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ArrTime**: Actual arrival time (local, hhmm).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CRSArrTime**: Scheduled arrival time (local, hhmm).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **UniqueCarrier**: Unique Carrier Code. It is the Carrier Code most recently used by a carrier. A numeric suffix is used to distinguish duplicate codes, for example, PA, PA (1), PA (2). This field is to be used to perform analysis of data reported by one and only one carrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FlightNum**: A one to four character alpha-numeric code for a particular flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TailNum**: Plane tail number; aircraft registration, unique aircraft identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CRSElapsedTime**: Scheduled elapsed time computed from gate departure time to gate arrival time. In minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ActualElapsedTime**: elapsed time computed from gate departure time to gate arrival time. In minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AirTime**: The time spent by the plane in the air. In minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ArrDelay**: Arrival delay of the flight, in minutes. Arrival delay equals the difference of the actual arrival time minus the scheduled arrival time. A flight is considered on-time when it arrives less than 15 minutes after its published arrival time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DepDelay**: Departure delay of the flight, in minutes. It is the difference between the scheduled departure time and the actual departure time from the origin airport gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Origin**: Origin IATA airport code. Supposedly, this is the origin airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dest**: Destination IATA airport code. Supposedly, this is the destination airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Distance**: The distance of the flight. In miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TaxiIn**: Taxi-in time, in minutes. The time elapsed between wheels down and arrival at the destination airport gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TaxiOut**: Taxi-out time, in minutes. The time elapsed between departure from the origin airport gate and wheels off.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cancelled**: A flight that was listed in a carrier's computer reservation system during the seven calendar days prior to scheduled departure but was not operated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CancellationCode**: reason for cancellation (A = carrier, B = weather, C = NAS, D = security)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Diverted**: 1 = yes, 0 = no. Indicate whether or not a flight was required to land at a destination other than the original scheduled destination for reasons beyond the control of the pilot/company.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CarrierDelay**: In minutes. Carrier delay record the delays that are within the control of the air carrier. Examples of occurrences that may determine carrier delay are: aircraft cleaning, aircraft damage, awaiting the arrival of connecting passengers or crew, baggage, bird strike, cargo loading, catering, computer, outage-carrier equipment, crew legality (pilot or attendant rest), damage by hazardous goods, engineering inspection, fueling, handling disabled passengers, late crew, lavatory servicing, maintenance, oversales, potable water servicing, removal of unruly passenger, slow boarding or seating, stowing carry-on baggage, weight and balance delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **WeatherDelay**: In minutes. Weather delay is caused by extreme or hazardous weather conditions that are forecasted or manifest themselves on point of departure, enroute, or on point of arrival.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NASDelay**: In minutes. Delay that is within the control of the National Airspace System (NAS) may include: non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, air traffic control, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SecurityDelay**: In minutes. Security delay is caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LateAircraftDelay** in minutes: Arrival delay at an airport due to the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport. The ripple effect of an earlier delay at downstream airports is referred to as delay propagation.\n",
